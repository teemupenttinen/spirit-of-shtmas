# Spirit of Sh*tmas

## What is this?

This will be *the gameshow game* of the Christmas. 

It will be brutal and christmas spirit breaking experience.

Not entirely sure what this will evolve into, but expecting to boost the spirit of 2021 Christmas with it.

## Development

This most likely will be fully client-side implementation. 

Run the app with:

    npm start

Demo app can be found from http://spirit-of-shtmas.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/

## PoC design & idea

Here you can find the PoC design done in Figma

Idea of the game is following:
- To get best experience, either mirror the game to an external monitor and/or use tablet or laptop and place it to the middle of the players.
- The players advance on wintry landscape trying to save Christmas.
- The players,probably 2-6, will play as a team.
- Team has to answer to a number of questions and survive to the end with at least 1 player alive.
- Questions are given only the answers first and then the team will decide who will be able to answer to the question. 
- When answering the other players must be silent
- If the player answers wrong, he/she must choose who will be sacrificed and kicked out from the game.
- There will be different kinds of lifelines to use to help with questions.
- Possible lifelines could be, 50:50 which eliminates two answers, Ask Google (if implementation is possible)
- Sacrificed players can be resurrected (TBD how)
- The game can be paused!
